# Protein-Secondary-Structure-Predictor-project
C++ script that implements a simple predictor for protein secondary structures, This script reads the training data from the trainSS file, computes the frequencies of amino acids in different secondary structures, and then predicts the secondary structure for the test dataset in the testSS file.
